  - **Efficiency Ratios:** Asset turnover ratio, Inventory turnover ratio, Receivables turnover ratio.
  - **Profitability Ratios:** Gross margin ratio, Operating margin ratio, Return on assets, Return on equity.
- **Trend Analysis:**  
  - Compare financial performance across multiple periods if available.
- **Conditional Analysis:**  
  - Adjusted EBITDA & Adjusted Working Capital calculations if detailed info is provided.

### 2.4 Report Generation

  1. **Business Overview:** Summary of the company.
  2. **Key Findings & Financial Due Diligence:** Highlights and risks.
  3. **Income Statement Overview:** Summary of revenue, expenses, profits.
  4. **Balance Sheet Overview:** Summary of assets, liabilities, and equity.
  5. **Adjusted EBITDA:** Analysis if detailed inputs exist.
  6. **Adjusted Working Capital:** Analysis if detailed inputs exist.
- **Report Format:**  
  - Clear headings and bullet points.
  - Consistent, structured JSON that is later rendered in a user-friendly format.
- **PDF Generation:**  
  - Use a Python PDF library (e.g., ReportLab, FPDF, or WeasyPrint) to generate a downloadable report.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 AI & NLP Implementation
- **Primary LLMs:**
  - **Gemini 2.0 Flash:** For document extraction.
  - **Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking:** For reasoning tasks.
- **Prompt Strategy:**
  - **Multiple, Chained Prompts:**  
    - Step 1: Document summarization & section identification.
    - Step 2: Detailed extraction of financial data.
    - Step 3: Financial ratio calculations and trend analysis.
    - Step 4: Final report assembly.
  - Use structured JSON outputs to allow easy merging of results.
- **Optional Tools:**  
  - **LangChain:** For managing multi-step prompt chains and agent workflows.
  - **LangGraph/Crew AI:** Consider for visual workflow management if needed.

### 3.2 Data Processing & Backend

## 4. Workflow & System Architecture

1. **Document Ingestion:**
   - Users upload PDFs, spreadsheets, or scanned images via the Streamlit interface.
   - Preprocess files (apply OCR if necessary).

2. **Data Extraction:**
   - Use Gemini 2.0 APIs to extract content.
   - Parse and structure extracted data into JSON.

3. **LLM Analysis:**
   - Chain multiple prompts to:
     - Summarize document sections.
     - Extract key numerical data and text.
     - Calculate financial ratios.
   - Merge JSON outputs from each prompt for a comprehensive analysis.

4. **Report Assembly:**
   - Combine structured data into a final report with required sections.
   - Render the report in Streamlit.
   - Provide options for PDF generation.

5. **API Integration & Testing:**
   - Develop REST API endpoints for each module (extraction, analysis, report generation).
   - Test the end-to-end workflow with sample documents (refer to provided input examples).
